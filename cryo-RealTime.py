    plt.xlabel("Date and Time") # Date and Time x-axis label for all plots
    #plt.gcf().autofmt_xdate() # makes x-axis labels look nice, but the first label may stretch pretty far past the y-axis, so it might be undesirable; I have rotation=deg available above in ax.set_xticklabels(); another option is label.set_rotation
    plt.gcf().subplots_adjust(bottom=0.5)
    plt.tight_layout() # gets rid of extra white space on edges when saving the figure, but apparently you can also add arguments to plt.tight_layout(), so you should look at it more here: https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.tight_layout.html
    plt.draw() # if you use plt.show(), some of the axis labels may be missing or not what you wanted

    print("Sleeping for %s seconds" % sleepTime)
    #time.sleep(sleepTime)
    plt.pause(sleepTime) # waits sleepTime amount of seconds before taking sample again; interestingly, the program adds 10 seconds, meaning that the recorded time delay on cryo-LS372-Temp.dat is sleepTime + 10 seconds (so if sleepTime is 80 seconds, the time delay between recorded measurements is 90 seconds); I believe this also happens if you use time.sleep()
