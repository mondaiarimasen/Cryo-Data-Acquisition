This data sheet records relevant data about the environment of room with the cryostat. Please preserve the order of variables below (the order is also written in README.txt) and also preserve the whitespaces/empty lines inbetween lines as the positions of variables are hardcoded in programs that reference this document. Please don't add punctuation after each line (example of an ideal line: variable_name = 4). If you want to add new variables, add them to the end of the list, before the "Notes" section, and provide a brief description in the "Notes" section (following the previous entries):
